description: Bootstrap or align an Effect 4 project to the house setup — beta deps, tsgo + effect-tsgo patch, @effect/language-service tsconfig plugin, and the effect-solutions consultation rule. Use when a project needs Effect installed for the first time, when migrating from Effect 3 to Effect 4 beta, or when adding tsgo config to an existing Effect 4 project.

# Effect Setup

Bootstrap or repair an Effect 4 project

- **Effect 4 beta** (`effect@4.0.0-beta.x`, `@effect/platform-*`) — not Effect 3.
- **`tsgo`** (TypeScript 7's native Go-based toolchain) for type-checking, patched for Effect via `effect-tsgo patch` from `@effect/tsgo`.
- **`@effect/language-service`** as a tsconfig plugin so editors get Effect-aware diagnostics and refactors.
- **Bare-module imports** (`import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"`), not `import { Effect } from "effect"`.
- **`effect-solutions`** is consulted before writing Effect code — record this in `AGENTS.md`.

## When to invoke

Run when the user says any of: "set up effect", "add effect to this project", "match the effect setup", "configure tsgo for effect", "wire effect-tsgo", or when starting a new project that will use Effect 4.

Do **not** run unprompted on a project that already has Effect 3 stable working — migrating to Effect 4 beta is a deliberate choice the user must opt into.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Inspect the project

Before changing anything, read:

- `package.json` — what's installed, what version of `effect` (if any), whether `@effect/tsgo` is present.
- `tsconfig.json` — current compilerOptions, plugins, schema reference.
- `mise.toml` if present (the repo uses mise for tasks).
- `AGENTS.md` to see whether the effect-solutions rule is already documented.

Determine which of the three pieces (deps, tsconfig, AGENTS.md) are missing or out of date. Only touch the missing pieces — don't churn files that already match.

### Step 2 — Confirm scope (only if ambiguous)

If the project already has `effect@3.x` installed, ask before bumping to beta. For greenfield projects with nothing in place, just proceed.

### Step 3 — Apply each piece

#### 3a. `package.json` — beta deps + scripts

Target shape (versions are the house baseline; let `bun install` resolve to current latest beta if the user prefers):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsgo --noEmit",
    "prepare": "effect-tsgo patch"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@effect/tsgo": "^0.19.0",
    "typescript": "7.0.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "effect": "4.0.0-beta.92"
  }
}
```

For React projects, also add:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@effect/atom-react": "^4.0.0-beta.92"
  }
}
```

For Bun/Node platform packages, pin to the same beta line as `effect`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@effect/platform-bun": "4.0.0-beta.92",
    "@effect/platform-node": "4.0.0-beta.92"
  }
}
```

Critical notes:

- `prepare: "effect-tsgo patch"` runs automatically after `bun install`. This patches the `tsgo` binary to understand Effect's type-level constructs. Without it, `tsgo --noEmit` reports spurious errors on Effect code.
- `tsgo` ships with stable `typescript@7` — pin the current stable release (`7.0.2`) as a devDependency. The old `@typescript/native-preview` package is no longer needed.
- After editing `package.json`, run `bun install` so the `prepare` hook fires and patches tsgo.

#### 3b. `tsconfig.json` — language service plugin

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Effect-TS/language-service/refs/heads/main/schema.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "Preserve",
    "moduleDetection": "force",
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "allowJs": true,
    "types": ["bun"],

    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "noEmit": true,
 
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,

    "plugins": [
      { "name": "@effect/language-service" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Key bits to preserve when merging into an existing tsconfig:

- The `$schema` line — it gives the user JSON-schema completion for Effect-aware tsconfig fields.
- `plugins: [{ "name": "@effect/language-service" }]` — required for editor refactors like "Add missing yield\*", "Add tag annotation", etc.
- `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` and `module: "Preserve"` — Effect 4 ships with explicit `import type` discipline; these settings keep the bundler honest.
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` — Effect's `Schema` and `Match` patterns assume this.

#### 3c. `AGENTS.md` — effect-solutions rule

Append this section if not already present:

```markdown
## Effect Best Practices

**IMPORTANT:** Always consult effect-solutions before writing Effect code.

Resolve the `effect-solutions` command (it may be installed in several places):

- **Local (npm):** `bunx effect-solutions` / `npx effect-solutions` if it's in the project's dependencies.
- **mise:** `mise exec -- effect-solutions` (or just `effect-solutions` if mise has shimmed it onto `PATH`).
- **Global:** `effect-solutions` directly if installed globally.

Then:

1. Run `effect-solutions list` to see available guides
2. Run `effect-solutions show <topic>...` for relevant patterns (supports multiple topics)
3. Search `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect` for real implementations

Topics: quick-start, project-setup, tsconfig, basics, services-and-layers, data-modeling, error-handling, config, testing, cli.

Never guess at Effect patterns - check the guide first.
```

### Step 4 — Verify

After all writes:

```bash
bun install            # triggers `effect-tsgo patch`
bun run typecheck      # should succeed (or surface real errors, not Effect-internal ones)
```

If `typecheck` fails with errors inside `node_modules/effect/**`, the patch didn't take — re-run `bunx effect-tsgo patch` manually and report which file the error is in.

## Import conventions (worth flagging to the user)

Effect 4 ships with deeply-nested module paths. The house style is bare-module imports, not the barrel:

```ts
// ✅ House style
import * as Effect from "effect/Effect";
import * as Layer from "effect/Layer";
import * as Schema from "effect/Schema";
import * as Atom from "effect/unstable/reactivity/Atom";
import * as AtomRegistry from "effect/unstable/reactivity/AtomRegistry";

// ❌ Avoid (works, but bigger bundles + slower TS)
import { Effect, Layer, Schema } from "effect";
```

Atom/AtomRegistry live under `effect/unstable/reactivity/` in beta — that's not a typo, the API is still stabilizing.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not write Effect application code. For that, follow the AGENTS.md rule and consult `effect-solutions`.
- Does not migrate Effect 3 codebases to Effect 4 — the API surface changed substantially. If asked, warn the user that this is a separate, larger task.
- Does not add `@effect/platform-*`, `@effect/atom-react`, or other ecosystem packages unless the project clearly needs them. Ask.

## Quick reference: full file set for a new project

If the user wants everything wired from scratch with no existing code:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `package.json` | Beta deps + `typecheck` / `prepare` scripts |
| `tsconfig.json` | `@effect/language-service` plugin, strict opts |
| `AGENTS.md` | effect-solutions rule |
| `bunfig.toml` (optional) | Bun preload stubs if targeting Workers |
| `mise.toml` (optional) | Task definitions matching `package.json` scripts |

Create only the files the user actually wants — don't add `mise.toml` if they're not on mise.
